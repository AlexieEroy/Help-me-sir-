            <p>We might have thought at one point, “How common is it to have an allergy?”. This data will be reporting the number of people in Batch 2027 who has allergies. Allergies are medical occurrences where our immune system reacts to a foreign substance (Mayo Clinic, 2022). Our data aims to show how many students in Batch 2027 has a diagnosed allergy to conclude how common it is for a person to have an allergy and how many allergies do they have. The population of our target respondents is 120 students however, only 51 students were able to respond to our forms so our data that will be presented is a sample data.</p>
            <br><p>We have collected our necessary data through Google Forms. In that Google forms, we were able to collect the following:</p>
            <br><ul>
                <li>Qualitative Variables: student's section and gender</li>
                <li>Quantitative Variables: Student's age and number of allergies</li>
            </ul>
